    <h2>Project ideas</h2>
    <p>Possibilities for a site for my final include:</p>
    <p>Expand on Fallout Character Creator by adding more to the creator and data page. make it more complex for final using React. Possibly use final project from WebDev that was made last year. Add more functionality such as randomizer for stats and/or a questionaire that can effect the stats based on answers.  </p>
    <p>Making a todo application with React that allows you to check off items as you complete them. </p>
    <p>Online store for gaming materials such as dice, cards, player guides or book store</p>
